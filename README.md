# CNF-SAT-solver

Boolean Satisfiability solver for ECE51216 at Purdue University. Given a CNF formula, finds assignment of variables that makes the formula true. This project aims to implement VSIDS and non-chronological backtracking heuristics in the DPLL algorithm.

There are several applications for SAT within EDA, including automatic test pattern generation and combinational equivalence checking. 
Since SAT is known to be an NP-Complete problem, generalized algorithms for solving SAT may not be enough of a solution. 
Additional information about circuit structure, alongside heuristics, can be used to significantly speed up the algorithm.
